# table-soccer-speedometer
Arduino based measuring and displaying ball speed on a table soccer  
Currently this project is only a prototype. With a few light barriers it is possible to calculate the flight height of the ball. based on the flight height we can calculate the speed.  

The ball may impact the goal surface from different angles (left, right, ascending, descending). However, in this experimental setup, this can be neglected, and we assume that the ball always approaches the goal surface at exactly 90 degrees. Acceleration or deceleration of the ball during the measurement process can also be ignored.
